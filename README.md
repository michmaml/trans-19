# Imperfections and limitations of my Sprint 1

I have managed to fully cover the Product Backlog for this iteration. Using the tutorial I set up a way to display the patients and their cases(trips). Unfortunately, I could not get my head around displaying the second table within the same url - I designed my prototypes so that once a CHP Staff clicks on one of the patients, a list of his/hers trips would appear next to it but due to the limitations, I was forced to change my initial design plan. I also implemented an option to register and log in(no Epidemiologists yet) but actually the tables can be accessed without registering. I need to still add a verification/state that would display the tables if a user is logged in and if not - do not.

# Update for iteration 2

Our team is doing amazing, every aspect of Scrum methology is fulfiled to every possible extent and the UI was created with a very good attention to detail - we made sure the website is accessible by choosing good contrasting colours or clear fonts(and their sizes). Now, CHP Staff can maintain* patients, their trips to various locations within HK and search for possible connections between within given date ranges.
Huge thanks to all of my teammates for our incredible dedication and everyone's contribution!
