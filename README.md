# Imperfections and limitations of my Sprint 1

I have managed to fully cover the Product Backlog for this iteration. Using the tutorial I set up a way to display the patients and their cases(trips). Unfortunately, I could not get my head around displaying the second table within the same url - I designed my prototypes so that once a CHP Staff clicks on one of the patients, a list of his/hers trips would appear next to it but due to the limitations, I was forced to change my initial design plan. I also implemented an option to register and log in(no Epidemiologists yet) but actually the tables can be accessed without registering. I need to still add a verification/state that would display the tables if a user is logged in and if not - do not.
